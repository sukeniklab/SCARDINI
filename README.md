# SCARDINI++ Pipeline

## This creates a combined csv of Sparrow, CIDER, and NARDINI+ sequence parameters from a FASTA file. By default, Z_scores from NARDINI+ are calculated using S. Cerevisiae as reference. 
## STRONGLY recommended to create a new environment for this pipeline to work. The install script should work--and if there are errors, run the script to completion and import the packages to test functionality.
